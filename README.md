Project for the course EE-559 : Deep Learning.

Submitted on Saturday, 28 May 2022, 01:15.

The project statement is available in: EE559_2022ProjDescription.pdf

Design choices and implementation are explained in Miniproject_1/Report_1.pdf and Miniproject_1/Report_2.pdf

## Recap and results:
Miniproject_1 consist of implementing a Noise2Noise autoencoder using PyTorch framework.

Miniproject_2 consist of implementing the same Network from scratch (without PyTorch framework).

Here are results of both model trained under same conditions, on 3 random image of the validation set:
